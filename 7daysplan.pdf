7-Day Project Plan for Creating a Basic Blog Application

Day 1: Backend Setup

    Objective: Set up the backend with a RESTful API and database.
    Tasks:
    Choose the backend framework (Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, or Ruby on Rails).
    Initialize the project and set up the folder structure.
    Create the necessary routes for the API:
    GET /posts
    GET /posts/:id
    POST /posts
    PUT /posts/:id
    DELETE /posts/:id
    Implement a simple database model for blog posts (e.g., title, content, date).
    Test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman.

Day 2: Database Management

    Objective: Integrate the database with the backend and implement error handling.
    Tasks:
    Choose a database (SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL: MongoDB).
    Set up the database connection in the backend.
    Implement CRUD operations for blog posts using the chosen database.
    Add basic error handling and input validation for the API.
    Test the API with the database integration.

Day 3: Frontend Setup

    Objective: Set up the frontend framework and create a basic layout.
    Tasks:
    Choose a frontend framework (React, Vue, or Angular).
    Initialize the frontend project and set up the folder structure.
    Create a responsive layout with a header, main content area, and footer.
    Implement basic navigation for the blog list view and detail view.
    Set up state management (e.g., Redux for React) if needed.

Day 4: Frontend Development

    Objective: Implement the list view, detail view, and form for blog posts.
    Tasks:
    Implement the list view to display blog posts (title and excerpt).
    Implement the detail view to display individual blog posts.
    Create a form for adding new blog posts.
    Implement basic client-side form validation.
    Test the frontend components individually.

Day 5: Full Stack Integration

    Objective: Connect the frontend to the backend API and ensure smooth integration.
    Tasks:
    Connect the frontend with the backend API to fetch and display blog posts.
    Implement proper error handling and loading states on the frontend.
    Test the application by creating, updating, and deleting blog posts.
    Ensure proper state management across the application.

Day 6: Deployment

    Objective: Deploy the full-stack application to a cloud platform.
    Tasks:
    Choose a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Fly.io, Heroku).
    Set up the necessary configurations for deployment.
    Deploy the backend and frontend to the cloud platform.
    Test the deployed application to ensure it is fully functional.
    Create documentation with instructions on how to access and use the application.

Day 7: Final Touches and Bonus Features

    Objective: Polish the application and add optional features.
    Tasks:
    Review the application for code quality, UI/UX, and performance.
    Implement user authentication (bonus).
    Add a comment system for blog posts (bonus).
    Implement search functionality (bonus).
    Add unit tests for both frontend and backend (bonus).
    Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment (bonus).
    Finalize and update the documentation.
