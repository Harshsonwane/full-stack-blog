Objective
    Create a basic blog application with a list view and a detail view for 
    blog posts, and deploy it to a cloud platform. This task will assess your 
    skills in frontend development, backend development, database management, and deployment.


Requirements
    Backend (Choose one: Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, or Ruby on Rails)
    Set up a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
    GET /posts (list all posts)
    GET /posts/:id (get a specific post)
    POST /posts (create a new post)
    PUT /posts/:id (update a post)
    DELETE /posts/:id (delete a post)
    Implement a simple database model for blog posts using any SQL or NoSQL database
    Implement basic error handling and input validation


Frontend (React, Vue, or Angular)
    Create a responsive layout with a header, main content area, and footer
    Implement a list view of blog posts, displaying title and excerpt
    Implement a detail view for individual blog posts
    Create a form for adding new blog posts
    Implement basic client-side form validation

Full Stack Integration
    Connect the frontend to the backend API
    Implement proper error handling and loading states
    Use appropriate state management techniques

Deployment
    Deploy the full stack application to a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Fly.io, Heroku)
    Ensure the deployed application is fully functional
    Provide clear documentation on how to access and use the deployed application

Bonus Points
    Implement user authentication
    Add a comment system for blog posts
    Implement a search functionality
    Add unit tests for both frontend and backend
    Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

Evaluation Criteria
    Code quality and organization
    Proper use of frontend and backend technologies
    Database design and query efficiency
    API design and implementation
    User interface and experience
    Error handling and edge case management
    Version control usage (provide a GitHub repository)
    Successful deployment and application accessibility
    Quality of deployment documentation and instructions
